It was amazing.\\n\\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nAnyway, I can\\'t wait to go back!'"
